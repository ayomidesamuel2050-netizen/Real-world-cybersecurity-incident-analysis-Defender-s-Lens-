## Cybersecurity incident scenarios ##
### Yahoo data breach ###
The Yahoo data breach, which initially occured in 2013 but was publicly disclosed in 2016, remains one of the largest known data breaches in history.
This incident compromised over 3 billion user accounts and exposed personally identifiable information (PII), security question, and hashed passwords, creating a substantial impact on both Yahoo users and the broader cybersecurity community. Analyzing this breach from a defender-centric perspective provides valuable insights into attack vectors, system vulnerabilities, and preventive strategies essential for improving organizational security posture.

The breach took place in August 2013. Hackers gained unauthorized access to yahoo’s network and remained undetected for years.The breach was first disclosed publicly in December 2016, when Yahoo confirmed that approximately 1 billion accounts had been compromised. Later investigations revealed that the actual scope was even larger, ultimately affecting all 3 billion Yahoo user accounts.

The breach affected nearly every Yahoo user at the time, exposing sensitive data; like username and email adadress, telephone numbers, hashed passwords, and other data.
The breach did not directly expose financial data,but the compromised credentials allowed attackers to attempt account takeovers across multiple services where user reused passwords.
